# Data Engineering Project 1 — CSV to SQLite Import Pipeline

As an introduction, this project was based on my desire to learn about Data Engineering and asked ChatGPT to provide a brief and also review after I finished it. And this project is designed as **Project 1** in my Data Engineering portfolio. This project demonstrates a clean and structured Data Engineering simple ETL pipeline that ingests CSV data into a SQLite database using Python and Pandas.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Load a CSV dataset into Python using Pandas  
- Parse and clean selected fields (e.g., `date_added` to datetime format)  
- Create a SQLite database with a structured table  
- Insert the cleaned data into the database  

This project uses a Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset that you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization).

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, SQLite
